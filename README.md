A python based application to track and notify open slots for covid vaccination. It is based on the API provided for the COWIN website 

After the "Start Checking" button is pressed then based on the options selected by the user the application checks for the vacant covid vaccination slots in the area covered within the pincode.
The python script makes an API call every 5 seconds to check for the updated empty slots list. The API is provided on the CoWIN website.
